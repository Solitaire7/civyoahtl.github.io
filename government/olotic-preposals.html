bgbba, Seconded By: Spacevolcano, Date: 22nd July 2019</p><blockquote><p><s>The current system of proposals is a total shitshow, and after seven months of ineffectiveness last week things came to a head. I think we can all recognize that the system is broken as it is, so I&#39;m taking Orinnari&#39;s suggestion and giving it a little structure, as the Chieftain. The way that proposals, charter changes, and the like will be handled from now on is this:</s></p><ul><li><s>Somebody makes a proposal.</s></li><li><s>Another person says &#39;seconded&#39; and others can echo this.</s></li><li><s>This opens a 48 hour period to vote on the proposal.</s></li><li><s>If the proposal passes the citizenry, the Council needs to look at it and either accept it and implement that agenda or they need to reject it and offer valid reasoning.</s></li></ul><p><s>At the end of the proposal cycle, this channel will be cleared and its contents recorded for posterity so that it&#39;s not bogged down.</s></p></blockquote><p><strong>Proposal passed</strong>: Votes unknown.</p><p><em>(Amends <a href="/constitution/charter.html">The Yoahtlan Charter</a>)</em></p><h2 id="proposal-two-passed" tabindex="-1">Proposal Two (Passed) <a class="header-anchor" href="#proposal-two-passed" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: SpaceVolcano, Date: 25th July 2019</p><blockquote><p>Amend the wording of Article IV Section Two from the charter, replacing it with the words &quot;All citizens are afforded one voluntary vote when voting on proposals, confirming nominees to public office, or affirming new citizens to the Ololtic.&quot;<br> The current Article IV Section Two states that people are entitled to up to three votes, but this process has never been used and none of the institutions described for affording people their second or third votes have ever been created. In short, it&#39;s a dead part of the current charter that runs contrary to the working history and precedent that guides Yoahtlan institutions.<br> In addition, it is the opinion of the government that allowing institutions to privilege certain individuals with greater voting power opens the door to corruption and the presence of this clause within the charter constitutes a potential avenue for votes to be challenged in court over the legitimacy of the voter&#39;s ballot. It&#39;s overly complicated, we&#39;ve never used it, and it&#39;s potentially dangerous.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Proposal passed</strong>: Votes unknown.</p><p><em>(Amends <a href="/constitution/charter.html">The Yoahtlan Charter</a>)</em></p><h2 id="proposal-three-failed" tabindex="-1">Proposal Three (Failed) <a class="header-anchor" href="#proposal-three-failed" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Proposer: Lukasmaps, Seconded By: WackyAki, Date: 25th July 2019</p><blockquote><p>Currently, proposals are advanced by the citizenry, then voted on by the council. If the council rejects a proposal they provide a reason for its rejection and the citizenry can then override the veto with a 2/3’s majority.<br> Lukas proposal is to eliminate the Council’s review role and instead change the charter so that the High Justice reviews the proposal for constitutionality. In short, the idea is to replace executive review with judicial review.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Proposal failed</strong>: No Ayes, 13 Nays, No Abstentions</p><h2 id="proposal-four-passed" tabindex="-1">Proposal Four (Passed) <a class="header-anchor" href="#proposal-four-passed" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: bgbba, Date: 31st July 2019</p><blockquote><p>Change the charter so that the high justice’s term length is indefinite (until resignation, impeachment, or quitting) instead of three months.

However, the charter doesn&#39;t specify that the Alcuahtl has to be from the council. I believe that we should confirm that the Alcuahtl can be anybody and doesn&#39;t have to be an existing Councillor to be elected. This proposal would be to confirm this by changing Article II Section 7 from &quot;The Council is responsible for electing the Alcuahtl to be “first among equals” from among their peers.&quot; to &quot;The Council is responsible for electing the Alcuahtl from among the Ololtic who are not currently serving as High Justice or other created executive offices to be &#39;first among equals&#39; from among their peers.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Proposal passed</strong>: 16 Ayes, 2 Nays, No Abstentions</p><p><em>(Amends <a href="/constitution/charter.html">The Yoahtlan Charter</a>)</em></p><h2 id="proposal-six-failed" tabindex="-1">Proposal Six (Failed) <a class="header-anchor" href="#proposal-six-failed" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: WackyAki, Date: 28th August 2019</p><blockquote><p>Yoahtl&#39;s representatives for SATO can only consist of the Alcuahtl, Deputy Alcuahtl, High Justice, and current Councillors. There’s no sense in us restricting ourselves for no good reason, if SATO trusts somebody and we trust them there’s no reason that they shouldn’t be a representative in SATO. This is akin to requiring that America’s representatives at the UN consist of Senators, the President, or the justices of the SCOTUS.

However, with the server being down and Yoahtl is hibernating waiting for the next server, I propose that THIS SPECIFIC council remain in term past their “due” re-election time and remain as councilors until the next OFFICIAL civ server is released, with the next elections being 2 months after Yoahtl officially moved to the next server. This law shall not be re-enacted, but may be replicated for other server transitions where the main server dies. Other functions of government, such as our legal system and impeachment’s (except dereliction of duty related to being in game) shall stay in place as normal</p></blockquote><p>Above is a law that was passed after classics died regarding around when our next elections would occur (once we are on CivMC). However, with both renewed interest in the nation from old and new players I think we should have elections sooner than 2 months into the new server for two reasons. For one it&#39;ll give newer players to the nation a chance to interact with the political system and secondly we currently have the smallest possible council of only 3 people, if we have heavy activity on CivMC then we will need a larger council than this, and an election would afford us that.</p><p>Therefore I&#39;d like to propose that &quot;The current council continues to remain in place until the next civ server that Yoahtl officially moves to. With the next election cycle beginning at least 3 weeks after server launch AND beginning on the first, of the month, that occurs soonest after this period of time. Other functions of government, such as our legal system and impeachment’s (except dereliction of duty related to being in game) shall stay in place as normal&quot;. This would give sufficient time for us to get settled while also ensuring the number of councillors reflects activity level and means that individuals are not overworked</p></blockquote><p><strong>Proposal failed</strong>: 4 Ayes, 12 Nays, 2 Abstentions</p><h2 id="proposal-re-add-ololtic-law-supremacy" tabindex="-1">[Proposal] Re-add Ololtic-Law Supremacy <a class="header-anchor" href="#proposal-re-add-ololtic-law-supremacy" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Proposer: GDAN, Seconded By: Orinnari, Date: 14th April 2022</p><blockquote><p>Re-add &quot;Laws passed by the Council may not override laws passed by the Ololtic.&quot; to the chater as Article 2.4.c.
